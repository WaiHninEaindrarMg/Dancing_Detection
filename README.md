## Dancing-Detection
Multi-person dancing detection and segmentation is a collaboration project.
In this project, We focused on detecting people dancing and performance various movements. Leveraging a custom-trained YOLOv8 segmentation model, it was able to achieve remarkable results in both detection and segmentation tasks.


## Description
### Dancing-Detection
Multi-person dance detection is a computer vision task aimed at identifying and tracking the movements of multiple individuals within a dance sequence.
Utilizing advanced algorithms, multi-person dance detection analyzes video frames to identify unique body poses and movements associated with dancing.

### Calculate Binary Mask Area (Remove Noise)
For some of the false detections, We filtered out these false detections by calculating the binary mask area.
